# Capturi frontend coding challenge

### [ðŸ‘‰ Go to the challenge ðŸ‘ˆ](./CHALLENGE.md)

## Develop

> You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) installed

This project contains an API server and a React client application and is managed by [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/)

- run `yarn` to install dependencies
- run `yarn start` to start both the server and client application.

The server will be running on port `3001` and the app on port `3000`.

## Technologies

The client app has been bootstrapped with `create-react-app` with a `Typescript` template as well as the following libraries:

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) - A simple, modular and accessible component library
- [React icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - Include popular icons in your React project
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) - Data fetching and caching library
- [ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky) - HTTP client based on the browser Fetch API
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/api) - routing library for React

Feel free to replace any of these libraries with something you are more familiar with.
